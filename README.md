</p>
<p><b>1. Intake:</b> A ticket is created by a user either via the web portal, by sending an email, or by staff on behalf of a user. The ticket is automatically added to the ticket queue and assigned a unique ID. The system acknowledges the ticket by sending a confirmation email to the user, confirming receipt of the request.</p>

</p>
<p><b>2. Assignment and Communication:</b> Once received, the ticket is reviewed by staff or automatically assigned to a department based on preconfigured rules (e.g., help topics). Agents are notified, and communication between staff and the user can begin via internal notes and public replies. The ticket’s status may change from “Open” to “In Progress.”</p>

</p>
<p><b>3. Working the Issue:</b> The assigned agent begins troubleshooting or resolving the user’s issue. Progress is logged through ticket updates, file attachments, and time tracking if needed. The agent may collaborate with other departments or escalate the issue based on the complexity.</p>

</p>
<p><b>4. Resolution:</b> Once the issue is resolved, the agent updates the ticket with a final response and changes the ticket status to “Resolved” or “Closed.” The user is notified, and the ticket is archived in the system. Follow-up surveys or feedback forms can optionally be sent to the user to measure support quality.</p>
